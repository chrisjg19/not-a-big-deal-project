# MiniMDB

## User Story

AS A Developer
I want to host a website that will help people find the minimal information about the movie they wish to watch.
The user will be able to obtain the title, summery, actors, and rating in a small information box, as well as preview the poster.

## Acceptance Criteria

Responds to user input.
Uses 2+ server-side APIs.
Uses modals instead of alerts, confirms, or prompts.
Uses client-side storage to store persistent data.
Is responsive.
Has a polished UI.
Has a clean repository.
